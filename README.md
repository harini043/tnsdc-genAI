# Traffic sign recognition
 To develop a robust traffic sign recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Keras to enhance road safety and efficiency in transportation systems.Collect and preprocess a diverse dataset of labeled traffic sign images, design and train a CNN model for accurate detection and classification of traffic signs, and evaluate the model's performance before deploying it into real-world applications.It is used Â to train model into autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring systems, and other traffic management applications, with continuous monitoring and maintenance to ensure sustained performance and contribute to improved road safety and efficiency.
